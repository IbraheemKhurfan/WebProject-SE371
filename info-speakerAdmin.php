            <p>Data Science and artificial intelligence (AI) are no longer theoretical fields of research, and we have started to see successful real-world applications for these fields. These applications have a huge potential impact on economic sectors, from the quality and availability of Healthcare to addressing climate and sustainability challenges. Technologies like Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision are slowly removing the need for mundane repetitive tasks, making people focus on more creative and value-creating tasks. To reap the benefits of these applications, the right policies, infrastructure, and talent need to be developed, and academic institutions must work alongside the public and private sector to secure maximum benefit from these applications.</p>

             <p>Linear algebra has joined calculus as an essential subject in understanding modern science and engineering. Universities need to teach the high points of the subject in a constructive way : not proofs but ideas and useful factorizations . Those include the classical applications of eigenvalues and the modern applications of singular values in data science. Deep learning creates matrix weights from the training data. Those weights are chosen so that a sequence of steps from the input layer to the output will model the data. Each step is a matrix multiplication followed by a simple nonlinear operation like ReLU: keep the positive part and zero out the negative part of each layer. The resulting model has been highly successful when applied to new data. Understanding this success is essential to improving and accelerating deep learning. We will identify key ideas in linear algebra that are part of the understanding.</p>

            <p>Natural language processing (NLP), from document search to machine translation and question answering, has become an important part of our daily lives. The quality of such technologies for Arabic continues to lag behind those for English and other languages. In this talk, we present the main challenges to Arabic NLP. First, Arabic is a complex language – it has a high degree of orthographic ambiguity and variety, morphological richness, and dialectal variants. Secondly, research and development for Arabic language technologies also suffer from limited human and data resources, as well as collaborations. We present several efforts addressing these challenges situated in a bigger vision for the future of Arabic and Artificial Intelligence.</p>

            <p>Advances in artificial intelligence and multimedia (audio, video, and image) synthesis and generation technologies are the main driver behind exponential growth of deepfakes and shallowfakes. The deepfake technology manipulates audio and video of a real people saying or doing things they never said or did. Deepfake technology is weaponizing information and social media platforms are adding fuel to the fire by spreading it instantaneously. Bad actors are taking advantage of deepfake technology to spread disinformation, disrupt elections, distort facts and introducing alternate realities, exploit vulnerabilities in biometric based access control systems and smart cities. Stung by bad actors interference in elections in the United States and throughout Europe, governments have made progress in investigating past intrusions, counteracting ongoing influence, and preparing for future malign operations. However, even as Western democracies work to construct responses and build resilience, the bad actors continue to develop new tools and re-tooling emerging technologies to spread false narratives and manipulate the political discourse. This talk will discuss trajectory of deepfake and shallowfake technologies and associated threats to national security, financial institutions, and smart devices. This talk will present a framework to debunk deepfake attacks in real-time. This talk will also present findings of our-on-going research on detecting fake audios and videos.</p>

            <p>Stance Detection from Supervised to Unsupervised Learning: What can computational methods inform us about peoples and societies? This talk presents state-of-the-art methods for performing stance detection using supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised methods. Stance detection aims to automatically identify the positions of people towards a particular issue or entity. Further, the talk delves into real life examples highlighting how stance detection can be used to understand societal trends, measure societal discord, and advise public policy.</p>
            <h5 style="color:darkblue;"><strong>About Dr. Kareem Darwish</strong></h5>
            <p>Kareem Darwish is a principal scientist at aiXplain Inc. working in the areas of natural language processing, computational social science, and machine learning. Previously, he was the acting research director of the Arabic Language Technologies group (ALT) at the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) and a researcher at the Cairo Microsoft Innovation Lab and the IBM Human Language Technologies group in Cairo. He also taught at the German University in Cairo and Cairo University. His research on natural language processing has led to state-of-the-art tools for Arabic processing that perform several tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, automatic diacritic recovery, sentiment analysis, and parsing. His work on social computing focused on predictive stance detection to predict how users feel about an issue now or perhaps in the future, and on detecting malicious behavior on social media platforms, particularly propaganda accounts. His innovative work on social computing has received much media coverage from international news outlets such as CNN, Newsweek, Washington Post, the Mirror, and many others. Aside from the many research papers that he authored, he also authored books in both English and Arabic on a variety of subjects including Arabic processing, politics, and social psychology. He also has a YouTube channel on social psychology.</p>

             <h3 style="color:darkblue;">Build End-to-End Machine Deep Projects and Manage Large-Scale Experiments <strong>(Tuesday 01st of March 2022 --Afternoon Session--)</strong></h3>
             <p>In this tutorial, I will briefly describe best practices for building large-scale reproducible deep learning projects, and for defining, launching and visualizing a large set of experiments. On Google Colab, starting from an empty project, I will show how to compare between 4 optimizers on two datasets and obtain visualizations that are ready to be presented in a research paper or project report. By the end of the tutorial, you will be able to build a deep learning benchmark, launch large-scale experiments, visualize them, debug failed experiments, and generate publishable results for a final deep learning report.</p>

             <p>Issam Laradji is currently a Research Scientist at ServiceNow company. He is interested at developing methods that require weaker supervision in order to reduce the amount of effort humans need for acquiring training sets. His current focus is on 3D computer vision that touch on rendering, synthesizing novel scenes, and learning to infer physical properties of objects. On the side, he occasionally works on new optimization methods for deep learning. He also continuously works on and maintains Haven-AI (https://github.com/haven-ai/haven-ai) which is a library for running, managing and visualizing large scale experiments in the hopes to make machine learning research accessible and reproducible to people.</p>
